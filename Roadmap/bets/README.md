# bets/ — the underwriting record

One file per wave, written at the wave boundary (WAYS-OF-WORKING → *Betting & appetite*). Each
file records the bets placed, their appetite, and — the whole point — **what each displaced**.
This is the opportunity-cost ledger a ticket board can't show: three lines per bet, not a
ceremony.

An unpicked pitch is let go, not backlogged; note it in the wave file only if it was seriously
considered. A seed's `underwritten_by:` frontmatter points at a file here — that pointer is what
makes "who authorized spending on this instead of something else?" answerable for every queued
item.

Shape per wave file (`wave-<date-or-slug>.md`):

| Bet | Appetite | Displaced (the opportunity cost) |
|---|---|---|
| what we bet on | S / M / L | what stayed parked because of it |
