# Platform migrations — Sprint 2: Money path — `migration` SKU + quoted estimate

**Status:** ✅ all 3 stories built (PR pending). Commits: `f73e832` (Story 2.1), `2104be3`
(Stories 2.2 + 2.3 — see note below), `11a76fd` (spec fix) on `feat/platform-migrations-s2`
(apps/miyagisanchez), branched off `origin/main` `2b1a483` (Sprint 1 merged, PR #220).
**Risk:** HIGH (money — **Daniel merges** every story here). Dark launch by construction: an
unpriced SKU is unsellable, so the SKU is inert until admin config prices it — no second flag.

**Build note — 2.2 and 2.3 shipped as one commit, not two.** The plan split them (estimator/
close-from-quote vs. very-custom routing), but in the actual implementation the batch
classification function IS the very-custom decision point — there was no clean seam to build
one without the other. `2104be3` covers both stories' acceptance criteria; see its message for
the full breakdown.

**Found + resolved during planning (not in the original epic doc):**
- Sprint 1's shipped `veryCustom = listingCount > 150 || truncated` would have auto-blocked
  every catalog Sprint 2 exists to price. Redefined to **`truncated` only** — safe since the
  connector is still fully dark (`migrations.connector_enabled=false`, never live). See
  `lib/migration-parity.ts`'s Sprint 2 note.
- The epic doc didn't specify the per-section adder amount. Set to **$199 MXN per parity
  section rated `partial` or `none`** (`MIGRATION_SECTION_ADDER_CENTS`, `lib/migration-estimate.ts`)
  — confirm this number with Daniel before/at merge; it's a one-line constant to change.

## Context
Pricing accepted at the gate (2026-07-09): white-glove **$999 MXN flat ≤150 listings**, commission
**50%**; above threshold **$999 + $3 MXN/listing beyond 150 + fixed adders per custom section**;
self-serve stays **free ≤500 listings**. Grooming verified `lib/promoter-pricing.ts` resolves
*fixed admin-set* per-SKU prices only — a per-merchant computed amount doesn't fit that seam, hence
the **quoted-estimate record** (decision locked at the gate): the platform computes AND stores the
quote; the close prices the SKU from the stored record; merchant and consultant see the identical
number; a close can never charge an amount that differs from the quote.

## Stories

### Story 2.1 — `migration` promoter SKU ✅ built (commit `f73e832`)
**As a** consultant (promoter), **I want** to sell a white-glove migration on the spot at a
platform-set price, **so that** a cash-first merchant can say yes in one visit.
**Acceptance:**
- [x] `'migration'` added to `PROMOTER_SKUS` + `DEFAULT_COMMISSION_RATES` (50%, seeded 50% directly
      via migration — not the usual 0%-then-admin-sets convention, since the rate was already
      accepted at grooming) + the admin SKU label — `lib/promoter-skus.ts`,
      `lib/promoter-commission.ts`, `PromoterAdminClient.tsx`.
- [x] Admin config prices it at $999 MXN via the *existing* generic `/api/admin/promoter/pricing`
      route (no new code needed — it's already generic over `isPromoterSku`); the close flow offers
      it like any SKU in the `/promotor/cerrar` picker — cash / card / net-remittance all work
      (`TRANSFER_SKUS`/`SKU_GRANT_KEYS`/`TRANSFER_SKU_LABEL` extended); commission accrues
      first-payment-only via the existing `markAttributionPaid` ledger.
- [x] The merchant-visible price and the promoter-visible price are the same number — `migration`
      has no separate discount layer at all (unlike custom_domain/subdomain/ml_sync), so the
      admin-set flat price (or the stored quote, Story 2.2) IS the final number on both sides by
      construction, not by a resolved-equal coincidence.
**Risk:** high

### Story 2.2 — Estimate generator + quoted-estimate record ✅ built (commit `2104be3`)
**As a** merchant with a big catalog, **I want** a platform-computed price I can see myself,
**so that** the consultant can't improvise a number.
**Acceptance:**
- [x] A **pure, unit-tested estimator** (`lib/migration-estimate.ts#computeMigrationEstimate`):
      inputs (listing count, count of non-mapped parity sections) → deterministic tiered price
      ($999 base + $3 MXN/listing beyond 150 + $199 MXN per non-mapped section). Same inputs ⇒ same
      number, every surface. `source_platform` is captured on the record for audit but doesn't
      affect price today (all sources treated equally — extensible later).
- [x] The platform persists the quote as a **quoted-estimate record**
      (`marketplace_migration_estimates`: inputs + computed total + `batch_id` — there's no separate
      `parity_reports` table to reference, the report is always computed on demand from the batch,
      confirmed during planning); merchant-visible on the existing Sprint 1 parity page via a new
      `MigrationEstimateCard` client island + `POST /api/sell/shopify/import/parity/estimate`.
- [x] The promoter close (`POST /api/promoter/close/migration`) prices the SKU **from the stored
      record** — the route's request body has no amount field at all, so a close referencing a
      quote cannot charge a different amount by construction, not by a runtime comparison
      (`lib/migration-charge-decision.ts#decideChargeFromQuote`, pure + unit-tested). No quote above
      the 150-listing cap ⇒ 422 refusal (`decideFlatEligibility`) — only the flat-fee ≤150 path is
      closeable without one.
**Risk:** high

### Story 2.3 — "Very custom" → route to Daniel ✅ built (commit `2104be3`)
**As a** platform owner, **I want** genuinely custom shops routed to me with evidence, **so that**
no one is silently quoted for work we can't do.
**Acceptance:**
- [x] When the parity report trips the "very custom" flag (**redefined this sprint to mean a
      truncated/untrustworthy pull only** — see the build note above; a plain >150 catalog is now
      the normal Story 2.2 estimate tier, not very-custom), no closeable price is generated —
      neither the estimate route nor the close route will ever price it; instead
      `tg.migrationVeryCustom()` notifies Daniel on **Telegram** (not email — this codebase has no
      email rail for admin ops alerts, only Telegram; adjusted from the epic doc's "existing
      Telegram/email rails") **linking** the parity report page (not an attachment — this codebase
      never attaches files to Telegram, confirmed convention). Deduped per batch via a marker on
      `supply_batches.acquisition_settings`.
- [x] The merchant/consultant see an honest "necesita revisión" state (the existing Sprint 1 banner
      copy, reworded this sprint from "cotización a la medida" to "te contactará directamente" —
      no quote is ever implied), never a number.
**Risk:** med

## Sprint QA
- **api spec(s):** pure spec on the estimator (`e2e/migrations-estimate.spec.ts` — tier boundaries at
  150/151, section adders, determinism, graceful degradation on negative/fractional input); pure
  spec on the close-from-quote decision core (`e2e/promoter-close-migration.spec.ts` —
  `decideChargeFromQuote`/`decideFlatEligibility`, **including the tamper case** — proven
  structurally, since neither function takes a client-supplied amount as input at all — and the
  no-quote-above-threshold refusal); `e2e/migrations-parity.spec.ts` updated for the redefined
  `veryCustom` boundary; 4 pre-existing SKU-vocabulary specs
  (`promoter-commission`/`promoter-pricing`/`promoter-transfer`/`promoter-earnings`) updated for the
  5th SKU. The `tg.migrationVeryCustom` notify call itself is a live side-effect (Supabase + Telegram)
  not exercised by a pure spec — covered by the smoke walkthrough instead.
- **browser smoke owed:** yes, to Daniel — the full money path: estimate above threshold → SKU close
  as a promoter (cash + net-remittance variants), plus tripping the very-custom notify.
  **(money path — owed to Daniel by name)**
- **deterministic gate:** `tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` + Playwright `api` green before merge —
  confirmed green 2026-07-11 (all touched/new specs pass; 6 pre-existing unrelated failures seen in
  a full-suite run — `launchpad-campaign-vote`/`launchpad-submission`/`not-found-shape` specs, zero
  overlap with this diff, last touched by an unrelated epic — traced to live prod's current
  rate-limit/WAF response shape, not this branch; one spec — the new estimate route's own gating
  test — 404s instead of 401 against **current** prod simply because the route isn't deployed
  there yet, same as every new route's gating spec before its first merge).

## Sprint 2 — Smoke walkthrough (do these in order)
Env: production · https://miyagisanchez.com (all of Sprint 2 rides behind
`migrations.connector_enabled` for the estimate/very-custom steps — flip it ON in a controlled
window per Sprint 1's own walkthrough, or run this on the branch's Vercel preview pre-merge; the
`migration` SKU itself needs no flag, only an admin-set price, per the dark-launch note above).

1. As admin at https://miyagisanchez.com/admin/promoter, price the `migration` SKU at $999 (it
   shows as "Migración de tienda" in the SKU list).
   → The SKU appears in the `/promotor/cerrar` close-workspace picker as "Migración de tienda",
   priced at $999.
2. As a promoter at https://miyagisanchez.com/promotor/cerrar, set up (or select) a test shop with
   **no** staged Shopify batch (or one with ≤150 listings), select "Migración de tienda", leave the
   "ID de cotización" field blank, and pay cash.
   → Close succeeds at $999; commission ledger shows $499.50 accrued (50%).
   **(money path — owed to Daniel)**
3. Run the Sprint 1 Shopify connector for a test shop against a real Shopify store with **more than
   150 products** (or a fixture achieving the same), landing at
   `/shop/manage/shopify/import/parity/[batchId]`. Click "Generar cotización".
   → A "Cotización para tu catálogo" card renders showing base $999 + the per-listing overage ($3 ×
   listings beyond 150) + any $199 section adders, totaling to the quote; a quote ID is shown
   (e.g. `Pégalo desde el reporte de paridad del comerciante`) for the promoter to reference.
4. Back at `/promotor/cerrar`, select "Migración de tienda" for that SAME shop, paste the quote ID
   from step 3 into "ID de cotización", and pay cash.
   → The charged amount equals the stored quote exactly (not $999) — visible in the commission
   ledger accrual. Attempting to close the SAME quote ID against a **different** shop is rejected
   (403, "La cotización no pertenece a esta tienda"). **(money path — owed to Daniel)**
5. Run the Shopify connector against a source that forces a **truncated** pull (a very large
   catalog exceeding the connector's page-fetch cap — see Sprint 1's `truncated` flag), then load
   that batch's parity page.
   → The page shows "Esta tienda es 'muy personalizada'... Un consultor de Miyagi te contactará
   directamente" — no price/estimate card renders at all; Daniel receives a Telegram message
   ("🔍 Migración 'muy personalizada' — revisar a mano") linking the parity report page. Reloading
   the same page again does NOT re-send the notification (deduped per batch).

If any step fails, note the step number + what you saw — that's the bug report.
