// prod-smoke.mjs — the daily production watchdog's checks, as a reviewable file.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AS A FILE. In the project this was ported from, the "prod smoke (daily)" routine
// predated the committed routines in scripts/routines/ and carried its assertions ONLY in the cloud
// routine prompt in the product owner's account — no git source, so no epic could ever update it. That
// cost twice:
//
//   1. market-architecture-foundation (shipped 2026-07-31) moved `/l` → `/mx/l` behind a one-hop
//      308. It updated lib/markets.ts in both repos with golden drift specs and updated the e2e
//      specs — and could not touch this smoke, which had no file to edit. The watchdog went red on
//      2026-08-05 against a route that had been correct for five days.
//   2. The same cutover turned `/` from the marketplace into a market SELECTOR. The homepage check
//      kept returning 200 and stayed green while silently testing a different page, and the real
//      marketplace lost smoke coverage entirely with no signal at all.
//
// (2) is the reason the checks below assert IDENTITY, not just a status code. A 200 tells you
// something answered; it does not tell you the right thing answered. Every check that guards a
// rendered page therefore carries a structural body marker.
//
// This watchdog earned its keep there — it caught a data defect CI reported green on. That is exactly
// why its assertions belong under review rather than in a text box.
//
// THE RULE THAT CONSTRAINS EVERY EDIT HERE: never make a red smoke pass by weakening it
// (scripts/routines/smoke-triage.prompt.md). When a route moves, re-point the check at the new
// contract and, where the move itself is a contract worth keeping, assert the move too. Do not
// relax an assertion to silence a red run — the origin's precedent was a strict assertion deliberately
// CONFIRMED rather than loosened.
//
// ── THE CHECKS ARE THE PROJECT'S (plugin-audit-and-extraction S3.1) ──────────────────────────────
// This file is the ENGINE: fetch, evaluate, three-valued exit. The assertions live in the project's
// committed scripts/prod-smoke.checks.mjs, which exports `BASE` (the production origin) and `CHECKS`
// (declarative checks — status, media type, identity markers, redirect targets, JSON shape, and
// `dependsOn`/`pathFrom` for a check whose path is derived from another's response). It is a module,
// not JSON, precisely so a derived check can hold code; it is still one reviewed file. Copy
// prod-smoke.checks.example.mjs to start. No checks file → exit 2 ("could not check"), never 0.
//
//   node scripts/prod-smoke.mjs             # run every check, human-readable report
//   node scripts/prod-smoke.mjs --json      # same, machine-readable
//   node scripts/prod-smoke.mjs --base=...  # point at another origin (default: the checks file's BASE)
//
// Exit codes are three-valued on purpose (AGENTS.md — "three states, never two"):
//   0  every check passed
//   1  at least one check FAILED (an assertion was observed false)
//   2  no failures, but at least one check was UNAVAILABLE (could not be observed at all)
// A run that could not check something must never exit 0. "I could not look" is not "it is fine".
