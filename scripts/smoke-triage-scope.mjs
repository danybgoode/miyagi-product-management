// smoke-triage-scope.mjs — may the nightly smoke-triage routine merge THIS diff by itself?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AS A FILE, AND NOT AS A PARAGRAPH IN THE ROUTINE PROMPT.
//
// Routine B (scripts/routines/smoke-triage.prompt.md) used to stop at a draft PR. Three nights
// running — 2026-08-15/16/17 — it produced a draft nobody merged, and the 08-16 and 08-17 drafts
// independently re-diagnosed the SAME defect from scratch. The nightly stayed red the whole time.
// A fixer that cannot land its fix is a fixer that re-does its work every night.
//
// So the routine now merges. The question that decides everything is "merge WHAT?", and that
// question must not be answered by a model reading its own diff at 10:00 UTC with nobody watching.
// It is a deterministic, reviewable predicate, so it lives here with node:test coverage — the same
// reasoning that moved the prod-smoke checks out of a cloud text box and into scripts/prod-smoke.mjs.
//
// TWO INDEPENDENT GATES, BOTH MUST PASS.
//
//   1. SURFACE — every changed path is test scaffolding (e2e/, the Playwright config, the browser
//      smoke workflow). A fix to app/, lib/ or components/ changes what customers get and stays a
//      draft for a human, no matter how green it is. The product owner's call (origin project, 2026-08-17).
//
//   2. NO WEAKENING — the diff must not make the smoke pass by asking it to test less. This is the
//      one that actually needs machinery. "Never weaken the test" has been written in the routine
//      prompt since it was created, and a prompt rule is a request; deleting a red spec is the
//      single cheapest way for any agent to turn a red nightly green, and it looks like a fix in
//      every summary it would write about itself. So it is checked against the patch, not asked for.
//
// Gate 2 deliberately blocks things that are RIGHT but not the routine's to decide. Retiring the
// zero-photo gallery spec on 2026-08-17 was correct — and it was correct because the product owner
// said so, after it had been surfaced to them twice. Blocked-to-draft is not "rejected"; it is the
// same PR, waiting for the person whose call it is. That is the intended cost.
//
// A blocked diff is NEVER discarded and never silently trimmed to fit. The routine opens the draft
// PR exactly as before and pings. Degrading to yesterday's behaviour is the correct failure mode.
//
// ── The policy is the PROJECT's, and it is REQUIRED (plugin-audit-and-extraction D4) ────────────
// Which paths count as test scaffolding, and which calls are assertions, are facts about ONE project's
// layout. The origin hard-coded its own. A template default here would be the worst failure mode in the
// whole epic: a routine in a project whose layout differs would ALLOW merges of things that are not test
// scaffolding, or miss the deletion of that project's own assertion helper. So both live in the
// committed smoke-triage.config.json:
//   { "testSurface": [ { "prefix": "e2e/", "why": "…" }, { "exact": "playwright.config.ts", "why": "…" } ],
//     "assertionCalls": ["expect", "expectListingFound"] }
// and an absent or malformed policy is UNDECIDABLE — never allow, never a default. Fail closed.
//

// Exit codes are three-valued (AGENTS.md — "three states, never two"):
//   0  auto-merge ALLOWED
//   1  auto-merge BLOCKED — open/keep the draft PR and ping (a normal, expected outcome)
