// prose-writer.mjs — the one rail every LOCAL prose surface in this repo writes through.
//
// PORTED from ~/dobby/golden-beans/scripts/lib/prose-writer.mjs (2026-07-26). What is NOT ported:
// golden-beans carries its own devin/agy spawn code because it is a separate repo. We already have
// that plumbing in `scripts/lib/cross-agent-cli.mjs`, so this file is a THIN adapter over it — a
// second spawn path would be a second place for the argv cap, the empty-output contract and the
// agy version pin to drift (sprint-1 build contract).
//
// Scope note (README D1): this is the LOCAL backend. A Claude Routine has no local CLI credentials
// — `hasCmd` returns false for both writers inside the routine sandbox — so the routines write
// their prose in-context and call the same pure guard as a separate `--post` step (D2). The guard,
// the persona and the lessons file are shared by both backends; only this writer is local-only.
//
// ── The router (README D1, and Daniel's call at golden-beans, 2026-07-26) ──────────────────────
// **Devin is the DEDICATED prose writer; agy on `gpt-oss-120b-medium` is the fallback.**
//
// This is a division of LABOUR, not a ranking. Codex and agy are the primary code reviewers and the
// builders lean on them, so their quota is the scarce resource — and this repo has already had the
// cross-family review layer go fully dark mid-epic when codex and agy were capped in the same
// session (2026-07-24, the reason devin was installed at all). Devin was added as a third review
// seat and sits mostly idle. Giving devin prose outright keeps the review quota free.
//
// The fallback is not decoration: agy carries a genuinely separate quota pool, and this repo has
// already been bitten by a single-provider rail going quiet mid-session (LEARNINGS — wire the
// fallback to the CONDITION, not to one of its signatures).
//
// ── PROSE_MODEL: one model, and deliberately not a Gemini one ──────────────────────────────────
// `gemini-3.5-flash-high` was `prose-draft.mjs`'s default until this sprint. That is the EXACT
// constant golden-beans identified as having silently destroyed the register of every report it
// wrote: the drafts people accepted had come from GPT-OSS, on the occasions Gemini's quota was
// exhausted and the pair fell through. The router was blamed and briefly reversed; the router was
// never the problem. The fix belongs in the model constant, so:
//   • ONE model. No model-level fallback, because a silent fall-through between two models with
//     materially different registers is a change of voice that nothing records.
//   • NOT a Gemini slug. If a future reader is about to "restore the fallback for resilience":
//     resilience already exists at the WRITER level (devin → agy, two separate quota pools). A
//     second model inside the agy path buys nothing and costs the register.
//
// ── Guard-and-retry, not guard-and-fail (README D3) ───────────────────────────────────────────
// Every draft, from either writer, goes through the pure `prose-guard` checks. A rejected draft is
// not discarded — the findings are handed back as a numbered revision note and the writer tries
// again. Only after that does a draft reach a human, and it arrives labelled with which writer and
// which model produced it and whether the guard passed it clean. A flagged report a human can
// correct beats a missing one.

// devin → agy already handled that correctly (the log has agy carrying a report devin refused), but

// cross-family review layer, which has already gone fully dark mid-epic when codex and agy were
// capped in the same session.
//
// codex is the natural third seat: it is already installed, already wrapped in cross-agent-cli, and

// there and argv carries only a short constant directive — no cap to hit, and nothing to guard.

 *
 * **Auth lapse and stale CLI are NON-retryable.** Both mean codex genuinely cannot run on this
 * machine, and a second identical attempt cannot log it in or upgrade it — retrying is pure latency
 * on the last writer in the chain, which is the worst place to spend it. Everything else (a cap, a
