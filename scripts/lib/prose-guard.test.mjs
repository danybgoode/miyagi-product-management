// prose-guard — the mechanical check that stands between a machine draft and a human reader.
//
// Both directions matter and they fail in opposite ways:
//   too LOOSE  → the measured hallucinations (invented beneficiary, unsupported fix claim, a
//                fabricated deadline, "it's live" about a flag-OFF epic) sail through, which is the
//                whole reason this file exists;
//   too STRICT → a legitimate report about a real fix for real merchants gets rejected, the retry
//                produces something worse, and whoever maintains this learns to bypass the guard.
//
// So every "must flag" case below is paired with a "must NOT flag" case. Ported from golden-beans
// with its suite, plus the flag-state-claim block that is ours (README D6).
