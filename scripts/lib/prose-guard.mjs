// prose-guard.mjs — a PURE, mechanical check on machine-drafted prose before it reaches a human.
//
// PORTED from ~/dobby/golden-beans/scripts/lib/prose-guard.mjs (2026-07-26), with the reasoning
// intact and one rule added for this repo (`flag-state-claim`, see below). The comments here are
// not decoration: nearly every rule records a *measured* failure of a real draft, and the reason a
// rule exists is the only thing that stops someone deleting it as noise.
//
// ── Why this exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Prompt instructions reduce hallucination; they do not eliminate it. Measured on golden-beans'
// commit-report rail (2026-07-25), a cheap model given a dense engineering commit produced material
// falsehoods on two of its first three runs: it invented customer impact for internal tooling, and
// it claimed a commit had FIXED an open-redirect bug when the commit only added tests for a fix
// that shipped weeks earlier. Both read as confident good news, which is exactly what makes them
// dangerous in a channel treated as status. Daniel reads our standup on his phone; a wrong report
// there is the real risk of this epic (README → "Risk tier").
//
// A guard cannot verify truth. What it CAN do is catch the specific, recurring shapes those
// failures take, and hand them back to the writer as a concrete revision note. That converts a
// silent falsehood into a retry with a named problem — which is the difference between "usually
// fine" and "fails loudly when it isn't".
//
// Everything here is pure and unit-tested: no I/O, no spawn, no clock. It runs on every draft
// regardless of which model wrote it (README D2 — the same module runs on the local rail and on the
// routine's `--post` step), so promoting or swapping the writer never silently drops the check.

 * Entries are usually flag keys (`promoter.activation_crm_enabled`), but any capability NAME works
