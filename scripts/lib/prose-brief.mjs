// prose-brief.mjs — the deterministic EVIDENCE PACK handed to a Claude Routine so it can write the
// standup / weekly recap in its own context (README D2).
//
// ── Why a brief instead of a writer call ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The local surfaces (retro, poster, sprint-wrap) call devin/agy directly through prose-writer.mjs.
// The two SCHEDULED surfaces cannot: a Claude Routine runs on Anthropic-managed infra with no local
// CLI credentials, so `hasCmd('devin')` and `hasCmd('agy')` are both false there and `writeProse`
// would return "no prose writer available" — silently producing NOTHING on exactly the two surfaces
// the epic exists to improve. Same headless-auth wall that made cross-agent-review-always local-only.
//
// So the routine IS the writer, and the split is:
//   phase 1  `--brief`               → this module builds persona + lessons + task + evidence
//   phase 2  the routine writes the prose in-context
//   phase 3  `--post --prose-file`   → the SAME pure guard runs; findings come back as a revision note
//
// Determinism stays in code; only sentence-making is model work. The guard is shared with the local
// rail, so a lesson learned on either backend protects both.
//
// ── Roadmap deltas lead, commits corroborate (README D4) ──────────────────────────────────────
// This is the whole reason our reports can be written at product altitude while golden-beans' are
// git-log-derived. Epic READMEs and sprint docs carry plain-language user stories and acceptance
// criteria — product language, written BEFORE the code. A report that leads with those can say what
// is now true for a person; one that leads with commit subjects can only ever be an engineering
// report with the adjectives swapped.
